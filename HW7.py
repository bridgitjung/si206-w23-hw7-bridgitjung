## [TASK 1]: 25 points
# Finish the function make_players_table

#     This function takes 3 arguments: JSON data,
#         the database cursor, and the database connection object

#     It iterates through the JSON data to get a list of players in the squad
#     and loads them into a database table called 'Players'
#     with the following columns:
#         id ((datatype: int; Primary key) - note this comes from the JSON
#         name (datatype: text)
#         position_id (datatype: integer)
#         birthyear (datatype: int)
#         nationality (datatype: text)
#     To find the position_id for each player, you will have to look up 
#     the position in the Positions table we 
#     created for you -- see make_positions_table above for details.

## [TASK 3]: 10 points
# finish the function birthyear_nationality_search

#     This function takes 4 arguments as input: 
#     an age in years (int), 
#     a country (string), the database cursor, 
#     and the database connection object.

#     It selects all the players from the country passed to the function 
#     that were born BEFORE (2023 minus the year passed)
#     for example: if we pass 19 for the year, it should return 
#     players with birthdates BEFORE 2004
#     This function returns a list of tuples each containing 
#     the player’s name, nationality, and birth year.

    # age (int), the database cursor,
    # and the database connection object. 

    # It selects all the players who play the position
    #  passed to the function and
    # that were born AFTER (2023 minus the year passed)
    # for example: if we pass 19 for the year, it should return 
    # players with birth years AFTER 2004
    # This function returns a list of tuples each containing 
    # the player’s name, position, and birth year.

# [EXTRA CREDIT]
# You’ll make 3 new functions, make_winners_table(), make_seasons_table(),
# and winners_since_search(), 
# and then write at least 2 meaningful test cases for each of them. 

#     The first function takes 3 arguments: JSON data, 
#     the database cursor, and the database connection object.
#     It makes a table with 2 columns:
#         id (datatype: int; Primary key) -- note this comes from the JSON
#         name (datatype: text) -- note: use the full, not short, name
#     hint: look at how we made the Positions table above for an example

#     The second function takes the same 3 arguments: JSON data, 
#     the database cursor, and the database connection object. 
#     It iterates through the JSON data to get info 
#     about previous Premier League seasons (don't include the current one)
#     and loads all of the seasons into a database table 
#     called ‘Seasons' with the following columns:
#         id (datatype: int; Primary key) - note this comes from the JSON
#         winner_id (datatype: text)
#         end_year (datatype: int)
#     NOTE: Skip seasons with no winner!

#     To find the winner_id for each season, you will have to 
#     look up the winner's name in the Winners table
#     see make_winners_table above for details
    
#     The third function takes in a year (string), the database cursor, 
#     and the database connection object. It returns a dictionary of how many 
#     times each team has won the Premier League since the passed year.
#     In the dict, each winning team's (full) name is a key,
#     and the value associated with each team is the number of times
#     they have won since the year passed, including the season that ended
#     the passed year.
